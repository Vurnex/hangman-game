# Hangman Game

A Hangman Game implemented in C language. This program goes allows the user to enter a nickname which will be used to store their score. After that, the game begins. 

If the user enters a correct letter of the randomly chosen word, they will be rewarded a point and the letter of the word will be revealed. If the user enters a wrong letter, they will lose a point. Once all points are gone, the game ends. 

This project was originally completed in Spring 2020 during my Sophomore year of my IT degree.
